# Craft detail guidance: controlled browser evaluation

Date: 2026-09-19. Baseline repository commit: `8762cbe`.
Decision: **PASS for the bounded fixture; real-product and independent-agent
effectiveness remain UNVERIFIED.**

## Scope and authority

The runnable original fixture is `evals/fixtures/craft-details/index.html`;
its adjacent `DESIGN.md` owns product context, tokens and geometry. No
production project, upstream demo, installed Skill or global route config was
changed. Before mode deliberately seeds defects; it does not show defects
discovered in a real product or prove that old Skill guidance caused them.

Actual skills: skill-creator for reference maintenance; source design-craft for
component implementation and visual/system review; browser67 for runtime.
Route: L1-V, normal risk, web, main_serial; explicit fixture DESIGN authority;
preflight passed after adding the required semantic section headings. No
subagent was used. Screenshots are optional in this component route but were
captured and reviewed for this comparison.

These bind the working-source instructions and fixture, not a released or
installed version. Prior source-bound certification is not renewed by this case.

## Observations and visual decision

| Check | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Canvas / theme | Before dark mode retained a white exposed canvas; after root resolves to rgb(23,27,28) in dark and rgb(244,243,239) in light, matching surface tokens. Existing theme-color updates to #171b1c / #f4f3ef. Browser chrome tint itself is unverified. |
| Corners | Outer 24px radius with 2px border + 10px padding yields a rendered 12px inner radius in after mode versus 24px before. The dark comparison visibly improves the corner gap. |
| Image edge | After light mode separates white media from its white panel with a quiet inner edge. Wrapper pseudo-element is pointer-events:none. Browser CDP pointer press/release at the visible media center activated Open media preview (counter 3 -> 4). |
| Optical correction | Only this triangle moves +2px; the square remains untransformed. It appears better balanced within the same circular control. This is a fixture-specific judgment, not a general rightward-offset rule. |
| Layout invariance | At 1100x850, card/media/play rectangles are exactly identical before and after. Play remains 48x48. Four after captures (two themes x two sizes) report no horizontal overflow. |
| Keyboard | Focused native play button activated once with Enter (1 -> 2) and once with Space (2 -> 3) using CDP keyDown/keyUp with text. An earlier combined dispatch omitted Enter text and yielded only one activation; that incomplete stimulus is not treated as two-key proof. |
| Focus | Both themes show an external 3px focus ring; light rgb(23,92,206), dark rgb(145,188,255). Media decoration does not replace the control focus style. |
| Text size | Root font-size 200% resolves to 32px. At a 390x844 viewport, full content is 390x1103 with no horizontal overflow; labels wrap and controls remain visible. This is text-size simulation, not browser zoom. |

Main-agent visual review: accept the refined fixture. The main content,
hierarchy, spacing, status region and controls remain intact. The light image
edge is clearer; the dark canvas no longer exposes a white field; nested gaps
are more consistent. Same-state play/stop siblings retain identical target,
border and focus grammar with a justified glyph-specific offset. No new motion,
loading, disabled, error, destructive or network states are introduced, so
those axes are not applicable to this offline fixture. This is not a blind
comparison or independent-agent evaluation.

## Screenshot artifacts

Runtime: browser67, one agent-created managed Chrome tab in an existing
dedicated Agent window. Page visibility was hidden; static PNGs were inspected
by the main agent. No foreground/focus lease, smoothness, touch or hardware
claim is made.

Artifact root: `~/.browser67/runtime/runs/design-craft-craft-details/`.
Every capture verified its requested viewport and PNG dimensions, then cleared
the temporary emulation override. The 200% text capture is full-page at a
390x844 viewport; its PNG is therefore taller. Artifacts are external runtime
evidence subject to retention, not distributed package assets.

## Reproduction and checks

Run `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m http.server 8769 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory evals/fixtures/craft-details`
from the repository root. Open the loopback page through the approved browser
runtime. Query parameters `variant=before|after` and `theme=light|dark`
select the initial state; the two toggle controls exercise transitions.
Use 1100x850 and 390x844 viewports. Focus play and dispatch genuine browser
keyboard input; DOM synthetic KeyboardEvents are not native activation proof.

- Skill quick validator: passed in an isolated uv environment with PyYAML 6.0.3.
  Initial system-Python attempt lacked PyYAML; the offline uv attempt lacked a
  cached wheel. No global Python dependency was modified.
- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 make lint`: passed.
- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 make validate-portable`: passed all 25 gates,
  including package boundary, source tests and development maturity.
- No text-matching tests or new validation framework were added for these
  original prose additions. Existing gates and rendered behavior are the
  relevant checks.

## Limits and cleanup

Safari/iOS overscroll, browser chrome tint, true browser zoom, touch devices,
screen-reader announcements, RTL/mirrored icons and broad image populations
remain unverified. No conclusion about overall Skill quality or independent
model improvement follows from one deliberately constructed fixture.

Same-instance scoped finalize closed and verified the one task-owned tab:
closed=1, verified=1, kept=0, remaining_unkept=0, errors=0. No user tab was adopted
or closed. The existing Agent window was reused and was not a cleanup target.
The task-owned loopback server was stopped after browser work. No install,
commit, push, version change or release was performed.
