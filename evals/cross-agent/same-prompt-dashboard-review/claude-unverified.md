# Claude unverified

- Host: Claude

- Status: unverified
- Reason: Claude Code `2.1.116` reports a valid OAuth login after the runner was
  repaired to retain user authentication and expose only read-only tools.
  Controlled `opus/max` and `sonnet/high` requests repeatedly ended with
  `API Error: Unable to connect to API (ECONNRESET)`, so no output or run
  manifest was admitted.

Do not count Claude as verified until the controlled runner publishes a new
output/run manifest and the recorder derives a valid v3 score from that run.
