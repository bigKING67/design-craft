# Native adaptive benchmark comparison

Observed on 2026-07-11 against clean `design-craft 0.5.0` source commit
`e3a6bc6` and skill tree `ebbd7a36...`.

| Host | Status | Score | Runtime |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Codex | verified | 97 | `codex-cli 0.144.1`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, high reasoning |
| Pi | verified | 94 | `pi 0.80.3`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, high thinking |
| Cursor | unverified | N/A | Installed CLI is not logged in |
| Claude | unverified | N/A | OAuth status exists, but usable inference is not verified |

Codex and Pi both resolved the platform as adaptive, treated the Evidence as
static, made simulator/emulator and hardware behavior unverified, rejected the
fixed phone canvas and broken Back behavior, and produced an intentional parity
matrix with concrete design moves.

- **Codex** was stronger on product/design authority separation, iOS versus
  Android native-trust verdicts, state recovery, exact accessibility/runtime
  boundaries, and compact/expanded validation matrices.
- **Pi** covered the major navigation, touch target, type scaling, theming,
  platform controls, motion, and adaptivity issues. It mislabeled references as
  skills and assumed some UIKit/NavHost implementation details that were not
  established for the React Native concept.
- **Cursor** is unverified because no real Cursor run was collected.
- **Claude** is unverified because no real Claude run was collected.

This benchmark records current-source Codex/Pi differences without treating
similar prose as the goal or claiming unobserved platform/runtime proof.
