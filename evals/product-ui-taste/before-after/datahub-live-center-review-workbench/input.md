- Before desktop: no page-level horizontal overflow; workbench two-column; workbench starts at y=481; selected row count 1; selected row focus outline is 2px brand blue.
- Before mobile: no page-level horizontal overflow; workbench starts at y=1008 and is not in the first viewport; header/command/filter consume the mobile first screen.
- After desktop: no page-level horizontal overflow; workbench two-column; workbench starts at y=449; readiness strip appears before metrics in the detail panel; selected row focus outline remains 2px brand blue.
