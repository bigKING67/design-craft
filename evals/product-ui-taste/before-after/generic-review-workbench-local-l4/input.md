## Runtime evidence

- Browser target: local static fixture served from `evals/fixtures/l4-pages`.
- Capture tool: Google Chrome headless CLI, writing repo-external PNG artifacts under `~/.tmwd-browser-mcp/runtime/runs/design-craft-generic-l4/`.
- Viewports: desktop `1440x900`, compact responsive `500x844`.
- Layout metrics: headless `--dump-dom` reads `data-design-craft-layout-metrics`; all four captures record `horizontal_overflow:false`.
- Interaction states: static fixture button state is visible; no hover, keyboard traversal, async loading, empty, or error states are claimed.

## Not verified

- Exact 390px phone viewport was not used because this local Chrome headless CLI run reports a minimum effective width of 500px for repeatable dump/screenshot evidence.
- No production app data, backend flow, authentication, network request, or real user workflow was exercised.
- No pointer interaction, keyboard focus traversal, hover, loading, empty, or error state screenshot was captured.
