# L4 before/after eval: ops-dashboard-decision-surface-l4

## Context

- Case ID: `ops-dashboard-decision-surface-l4`
- Product surface: local fixture at `http://127.0.0.1:4175/ops-dashboard-decision-surface/`
- Primary user: operations lead
- Primary job: identify the queue that blocks handoff and assign the recovery action without decoding an equal-weight dashboard.
- Design read: Reading this as a project-neutral operations dashboard fixture for design-craft L4 calibration, with calm executive-ops UI, optimized for turning routine KPI browsing into a first-fold dispatch decision.

This is a repository-local fixture, not an external product route. The before
and after variants are served from the same HTML file and selected with:

- Before: `?variant=before`
- After: `?variant=after`

## Runtime evidence

- Browser target: local static fixture served from `evals/fixtures/l4-pages`.
- Capture tool: Google Chrome headless CLI, writing repo-external PNG artifacts under `~/.tmwd-browser-mcp/runtime/runs/ops-dashboard-decision-surface-l4/`.
- Viewports: desktop `1440x900`, compact responsive `500x844`.
- Layout metrics: headless `--dump-dom` reads `data-design-craft-layout-metrics`; all four captures record `horizontal_overflow:false`.
- Interaction states: static fixture buttons and focus-visible CSS are present; no hover, keyboard traversal, async loading, empty, or error states are claimed.

## Not verified

- Exact 390px phone viewport was not used; compact responsive evidence is limited to `500x844`.
- No production app data, backend flow, authentication, network request, or real user workflow was exercised.
- No pointer interaction, keyboard traversal, hover, loading, empty, or error state screenshot was captured.
