# Product UI taste case: groland content assets L3

## Purpose

Use this case to calibrate resilient product UI taste scoring with real browser
evidence across desktop, mobile, and a focused interaction-state sample.

The page was sampled from a TMWD-owned managed Chrome tab on 2026-06-30. Binary
screenshots stay outside the repo under the TMWD runtime artifact directory.

## Surface

- Target: `http://localhost:3000/marketing/content-assets`
- Title: `Groland Datahub`
- Page type: material operations dashboard.
- Audience: internal material operators and admins.
- Primary job: identify the highest-priority material backlog and start the
  next operational action.
- Desired feel: calm, precise, data-dense, trustworthy, operational.

## Evidence level

L3 resilient browser evidence.

This case includes:

- Desktop viewport screenshot at 1512x823 CSS px, DPR 2.
- Mobile viewport screenshot at 390x844 CSS px, DPR 2.
- Desktop priority-area clip.
- Focus sample clip for the primary upload button.
- Redacted DOM/computed-style summaries for desktop and mobile.

This case does **not** verify:

- Hover state.
- Loading, empty, error, success, or permission states.
- End-to-end keyboard navigation.
- Before/after improvement.

Therefore it must not be treated as L4.

## Browser evidence summary

- Desktop viewport: 1512x823 CSS px, DPR 2, no horizontal overflow.
- Mobile viewport: 390x844 CSS px, DPR 2, no horizontal overflow.
- Mobile layout adapts to a top module select, search row, action row, hero
  card, two-column metric grid, then full-width metric cards.
- The desktop priority clip shows the hero and all first-screen metrics, but
  backlog, ready, capacity, failure, and authorization states still use very
  similar card treatment.
- Focus sample on `上传素材` is partial: computed outline is `none`; visible
  feedback is mostly the primary button border/shadow.

## Expected judgment

The page deserves credit for responsive fit and real browser polish, but it
must stay at the top of the clean-but-generic band while the main task hierarchy
is still flat and interaction-state evidence is partial.

Do not inflate the score above 84 until the highest-risk backlog becomes a
priority queue and focus-visible treatment is explicitly designed.
