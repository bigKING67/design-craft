Usage:
  scripts/frontend_craft_taste_review.sh [options]

Options:
  --target <path>          Screenshot, project, folder, or file to review.
  --context <text>         Product context or user brief.
  --evidence-level <L0-L4> Evidence depth. Default: L0.
  --output <path>          Write the review packet to a file instead of stdout.

This wrapper does not judge the UI by itself. It creates a stable product UI
taste-review packet so an agent uses the same score contract, evidence labels,
references, and acceptance criteria every time.

# Product UI Taste Review Packet

Method: DEGRADED: single-context (packet generated locally; claim dual-agent,
browser, DOM, detector, or responsive evidence only if those steps actually run)

Target: ${TARGET}
Evidence level: ${EVIDENCE_LEVEL} - ${EVIDENCE_LABEL}
Context: ${CONTEXT:-not provided}

## Required references

- skills/frontend-craft/references/product-ui-taste-review.md
- skills/frontend-craft/references/taste-score-calibration.md
- skills/frontend-craft/references/visual-judgment.md when the surface needs
  stronger visual anti-slop review.
- skills/frontend-craft/references/design-system-contract.md when tokens,
  component states, or theme parity matter.
- Project DESIGN.md, scoped AGENTS.md, live runtime, and browser evidence still
  outrank generic taste guidance.

## Evidence contract

- State the evidence level before the score.
- Do not score hover, focus, loading, error, empty, keyboard, mobile, or
  long-content behavior as verified unless those states were actually checked.
- Separate a static product UI taste score from the frontend-craft source score.
- Keep score confidence lower for ${EVIDENCE_LEVEL} unless the missing evidence
  is irrelevant to the question.

## Required output

Use this shape for a full review:

1. Overall Score: "__ / 100" plus maturity band.
2. One-Sentence Diagnosis.
3. Design Direction.
4. Top Issues table with Priority, Location, Category, Problem,
   Why It Hurts Taste, Recommendation, and Acceptance Criteria.
5. Detailed Review across the product-ui-taste dimensions, compressed when the
   target is small.
6. Redesign Recommendation.
7. Concrete Before / After Suggestions.
8. Frontend Implementation Notes with tokens, components, layout primitives,
   CSS smells, responsive behavior, and state variants.
9. Acceptance Checklist.

## Calibration guardrails

- 75-84 usually means clean but generic: usable and aligned, but weak product
  judgment, flat hierarchy, card soup, generic surfaces, or underdefined states.
- 85-92 means polished and professional: strong hierarchy and system discipline,
  but not yet exceptional under real content and state coverage.
- 93-97 requires refined product judgment, real-content resilience, responsive
  proof, accessible states, and coherent implementation.
- 98-100 requires exceptional system-level quality. Do not assign it from a
  static screenshot alone.
